Project: MGED SION Student Portal (Learning Management System)
**URL**: https://lovable.dev/projects/6dc6bdc2-c737-4112-bcca-c85250d00190

**Overview**

This is a student portal I created during my internship using Lovable AI—an AI-powered, chat-based development platform that turns natural language prompts into real, responsive web apps built with modern frameworks like React and Tailwind CSS .

**What technologies are used for this project?**

This project is built with:
- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS
Entire frontend generated using my free Lovable credits—Lovable gives 5 free credits per day.

**What I Did**
Used a plain-English prompt to describe the student portal’s requirements, system behavior, and UI—Lovable translated it into working code.
Learned and applied a new development approach while working in a realistic coding environment.
Integrated the generated code into my GitHub repo to maintain version control and documentation.

**What I Learned**
From this project, I learned how to work with Vite, TypeScript, React, shadcn-ui, and Tailwind CSS—all through working on a real app with AI assistance.

**Why This Matters**
First hands-on experience using Lovable AI for real-world development
Gained practical knowledge of TypeScript, React, and modern frontend tools
Demonstrated ability to take an idea from concept to working portal with AI-powered assistance

**Why This Version Works**
Clear and simple: Explains what the project is, how it was created, and why it's meaningful—all in clean everyday language.
Contextualizes Lovable: Describes what Lovable AI is—a chat-based tool that builds real apps from prompts.
Highlights learning journey: Emphasizes your experience of learning new tools and building something meaningful during an internship.
Tech details remain: Vite, TypeScript, React, shadcn-ui, and Tailwind CSS are all clearly listed.
